% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\begin{abstract}
Monoscopic imaging systems have drawbacks that can severely affect applications that use these solutions. These systems are mostly used in fields involving autonomous control of vehicles and remote control applications. The main issues associated with monoscopic imaging are a lack of depth perception and a narrow field of view. These deficiencies pose a serious problem in fields that use monoscopic imaging because depth perception is essential for being able to accurately control any system. Without depth perception, people and automonous systems must use vague spatial cues from two-dimensional images to attempt to control a system. A solution for dealing with the shortcomings of monoscopic imaging systems is the introduction of another camera to the system. This would create a stereoscopic imaging system. Stereoscopic imaging directly addresses the major shortcomings of a monoscopic system. Similar to a human's eyes, a stereoscopic system provides depth perception. This creates a three-dimensional image for the user, whether it is a human controlling a system or a machine making autonomous decisions based on visual stimuli. A stereoscopic system also provides a much wider field of view than a monoscopic one can. The benefits of using a stereoscopic imaging system make it preferable over any monoscopic system.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} use of machine vision and machine assisted human vision is increasingly utilized in many aspects of everyday life.  From industrial, military, business, medical, and entertainment applications, the integration of machine vision and interaction with physical objects is more common than ever.  More importantly, the integration of machine vision systems with remotely operated machinery, robotics, and vehicles is a crucial innovation that provides safety for people from hazardous environments, the ability to allow a specialist to offer expertise from a distant location, as well as bridge real and virtual environments and facilitate communication and interaction from remote locations.

However, while the integration of machine vision and remote systems operation is possible and occurring today, it is no substitute for first-person operation.  Despite the vast technological innovations in vision capture systems, two-dimensional, or monoscopic displays are most prevalent, and this type of display introduces errors and limits the abilities of those using such a system.

Due to the limitations of monoscopic vision, the use of stereoscopic vision capture and display is suggested as a solution.  Additionally, the implementation of such as system is proposed to be developed for the EEE/CPE Senior Design Project at California State University, Sacramento for the duration of the Spring 2015 and Fall 2015 Semesters.

\section{Societal Problem}
Most imaging technology used throughout society today is monoscopic, meaning it is a single camera system that provides an image to an end user. Single camera systems have some fundamental limits which constrain the system's functionality. Monoscopic image capture and display systems do not provide depth perception to a human that is using the system, or to a machine that is processing the incoming visual data. This means that the end user of the system, be it man or machine, has to deal with controlling something without access to the third spatial dimension. Obviously this creates a problem for accurately controlling any sort of mechanical system since having three-dimensional vision allows the end user to judge depth much more accurately. Another problem posed by monoscopic vision is that the field of view is a much smaller angle than that of a stereoscopic imaging system like human eyes. This can easily be confirmed by comparing the field of view an individual has with both eyes open to the field of view with just one eye open.

Monoscopic imaging systems are on most currently deployed UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), remotely operated aerial vehicles, and other remotely operated robotic systems. Due to the limitations of monoscopic images, UAVs rely on additional sensor data, such as GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Unit) so the vehicle can fly autonomously \cite{sanfourche}. These sensing systems only allow autonomous flight at middle to high altitudes since they cannot account for obstacles at lower altitudes \cite{sanfourche}. Since monoscopic imaging systems do not provide three-dimensional views, both autonomous and remote controlled flight are not possible to do safely at low altitudes. Since autonomous flight with UAVs is so heavily dependent on a GPS, conditions where a GPS is not available pose a serious problem for UAVs \cite{chowdhary}.  One of the possible solutions for this problem is to use a V-INS (Vision aided Inertial Navigation System), but these systems suffer from being computationally intensive \cite{chowdhary}. Even if monoscopic imaging could be used to accurately judge relative distances between a UAV and objects near it, the limited field of view caused by a monoscopic system would not allow the UAV to see objects that could still cause collisions with the craft.

Another field that is affected by issues with monoscopic imaging is medicine. Surgeons using a monoscopic system to perform operations on patients are forced to control robotic arms with no sense of depth. This is an application where accuracy is essential for avoiding any collateral damage to the patient. Research has shown significant differences in the performance of surgeons between using a monoscopic system and a stereoscopic system \cite{munz}. Surgeons using the monoscopic system required more movements to complete tasks than the surgeons using the stereoscopic system, and the surgeons' movements using the monoscopic system were less accurate than the movements of the surgeons using the stereoscopic system \cite{munz}. This research has shown that the limitations of monoscopic vision is a real hindrance.

\section{Impact}
While monoscopic vision has been a common and widely used image capture and display method, the lack of depth and other visual cues limits the effectiveness of object recognition.  Object recognition in current monoscopic vision systems is largely attributed to supposition, prior knowledge, or good guesses rather than physical certainty \cite{westheimer}.

The most profound impact of monoscopic vision is that because details are inferred and not physically certain, it can be inaccurate and cause errors. This is because a lack of depth and reduced object detection can produce incorrect results in performing tasks where full machine vision or machine assisted human vision is used.  Depth and vision are affected both to a great extent by the binocular matching, which is a process that finds which parts of the left and right eye’s images correspond to the same source in the visual scene. Another factor which has an influence on the depth of perception is binocular disparity.  The concept of binocular disparity refers to the slight difference in position of a visual image as seen by the right and left eye \cite{naquet}. The reason is because the right and left eye view objects from different angles, and thus would cause a little visual disparity. Stereoscopic depth perception works when each eye takes the visual information that it receives, and sends it to the brain to be united into one picture, where the slight difference of the images will add the illusion and perception of depth \cite{naquet}. Monoscopic vision lacks both binocular matching and disparity, and thus it has no depth, which may lead to erroneous and undependable results.

2D imaging technology is becoming less popular and it is being replaced by stereoscopic imaging technology, which can provide three-dimensional images. Stereoscopic vision systems are becoming part of our everyday life, and our society is becoming more dependent on these systems for various applications including remote surveillance, medical, and entertainment purposes. As the 2D vision technology is gradually starting to become obsolete, 3D imaging on the other hand is becoming more prevalent, and therefore replacing 2D imaging techniques. This is in part due to the technological advances during this past decade.

Stereoscopic imaging is not new, it has been a topic of research during the past few decades; at first, it was not well received by society due to a lack of visual quality\cite{bryant}. This was because software and hardware resources were limited, and thus it was an obstacle for engineers. Recently, stereoscopic imaging has been gaining ground amongst people because performance and memory are not as much of a hindrance as before. With the hardware and software resources available for engineers, and a lack of interest by the public for 2D imaging, the electronics industry is advancing stereoscopic vision. Therefore, more products are launched into the market that depend on stereoscopic vision \cite{bryant}. 2D vision systems have drawbacks that can negatively affect various fields and applications.

Monoscopic vision can be a disadvantage in the field of intelligent systems including robots and remote operated vehicles. Intelligent systems such as robots will require precision and accurate results when capturing data. Robots and intelligent systems capture data and based on the data that is received, then an action of some sort would be taken by the robot depending on the application. However, since the 2D data that will be received may be inaccurate because, by using monocular vision the distance of the object cannot as accurately be found \cite{segal}. This could cause an incorrect course of action to be taken, which can be of great concern when dealing with precision and accuracy. Another issue that occurs from monoscopic vision is that with the lack of depth perception a misrepresentation of a objects depth or width can change how we perceive it and provide a misconception of the objects size or shape of the object \cite{pollock}. The concern of exocentric distance perception in identifying and navigation with a monoscopic camera in medical devices could cause concern in specific medical devices such as laparoscopic devices are used in surgeries to navigate and identify particular areas in the human body \cite{pollock}. 

\section{Solution}
As a result of the limitations of monoscopic vision, researchers have investigated the use of both simulated and true stereoscopic vision as an alternative solution when a vision system is necessary.  Consistently, studies have shown that in a variety of scenarios ranging from complete machine vision to human vision systems, the use of true stereoscopic vision provides better results than when monoscopic vision is utilized.

In an article discussing the tracking of objects in orbit in space, the use of stereoscopic imaging in a machine-vision system yielded faster target tracking and increased robustness to field-of-view limits noise compared with monoscopic vision-based attitude tracking \cite{segal}. Additionally, these improvements had a fringe benefit of reduced fuel consumption in the systems utilizing the stereoscopic vision.  This is specifically attributed to the ability to accurately implement a model of the object being tracked without any ambiguity in the relative range since the angular acceleration can be measured using the stereoscopic vision.  

In human vision systems where the use of cameras augments a process or procedure by a person, research has shown that the use of stereoscopic vision improves the performance and results compared to monoscopic vision.  In a clinical study of using cameras to assist in dental implant procedures, the use of stereoscopic vision through independent optical channels improved precision in dental implant procedures compared to non-stereoscopic vision \cite{wanschitz}.  In another study utilizing the Da Vinci robotic assisted surgical system, researchers aimed to objectively assess whether stereoscopic vision improved the performance over monoscopic vision. The results of the study indicated that for all tasks and parameters there were significant improvements \cite{munz}. Additionally, a fewer errors were encountered while using the stereoscopic mode as compared to the standard two-dimensional image \cite{munz}.  Furthermore, in a paper published specifically to address the use of stereoscopic imaging in medical procedures, the concluding remarks indicate that stereoscopic vision offers significant clinical improvements for many aspects of medicine over monoscopic vision \cite{held}.  Specifically, in diagnostics, training, and remote surgery, the article identifies shortened task-completion times and reduced error rates due to enhanced shape perception in the absence of other visual cues.

Based upon the evidence, stereoscopic vision is an improvement over monoscopic vision.  For a system where the display of a remote environment is necessary, the use of a stereoscopic capture and display would be more efficient, accurate, and provide better results than a monoscopic system.

\section{Proposal}
To address the limitations of a remotely operated robotic system utilizing a monoscopic image capture and two dimensional displays, the team is proposing to design and build a remotely operated robotic manipulation device that integrates stereoscopic vision.

The system that is proposed would consist of a custom hardware design to capture stereoscopic image data using two independent cameras and transmit it to a remote head-mount stereoscopic display.  To provide a more natural interaction and response, the head-mount display would integrate motion tracking to reposition the remote cameras.  Additionally, a remotely operated robotic control system would be utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stereoscopic vision system.

At a high-level, the implementation is expected to be developed using multiple CMOS camera sensors for capturing image data, FPGAs for processing image data and forming high-speed data transfer between the stereoscopic image capture system and stereoscopic display, along with high-resolution LCD displays for displaying the stereoscopic image data.  Additionally, microcontrollers would be utilized to control any robotic or mechanical system in conjunction with the motion tracking head-mount display and camera repositioning.

If time and resources permitted, additional enhancements to the system could further improve the experience, such as implementing super-resolution image processing to improve the total resolution of the image data, object recognition and tracking, and additional feedback mechanisms to provide a more natural physical response to the end user.  Potential extensions to the implementation could include true remote operation over a local or wide area network.

\section{Conclusion}
Monoscopic imagining techniques have quite a few drawbacks such as difficulty in determining the depth or distance a object may be, as well as may create a distorted assessment of the objects size and shape. While this may appear narrow in scope, there are implications in full machine vision systems such as with unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as fields that utilize machine assisted vision, such as in medical procedures.  Furthermore, these implications are felt in a number of other fields that affect the safety and health of individuals, in the operational costs of various industries, and in the use of technology developed to otherwise facilitate tasks in way that are not possible without it.

Researched evidence supports the effectiveness of replacing monoscopic vision with stereoscopic vision.  Improvements in image capture technology, image processing technology, and display technologies indicate that this is attainable and possible.  The proposed implementation is reasonable in scope for the time frame spanning the Spring 2015 and Fall 2015 semesters at California State University, Sacramento, and given the abilities of the team members.
